# GAN-Inference
Non parametric SZ interferometric image reconstruction using generative models.

The idea is being able to model the SZ signal obtained via an interferometric observation, doing inference on seven parameters (6 elements of the latent vector + mass) that influence the generation of an image of a trained GAN.
